# Smile_4_Life

This code is currently being modified/corrected and can be found in SmileForLife repository.

I created this app as a way to learn swift/IOS language. I was fresh from DevBootCamp coding school which was Ruby/Rails/Javascript focus but Ruby/Rails seemed like if was on it’s way out. I felt that Swift was an IOS language that Apple was migrating to and would stay relevant. My journey has been interrupted by life and learning new “Swifty” ways and I am currently porting over the better code blocks into SmileForLife.
